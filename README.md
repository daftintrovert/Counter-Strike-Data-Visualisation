# Counter-Strike-Data-Visualisation

CS:GO with Python !!

Hello! I,Vishal Sharma, am the creator of this data-set and just wanted to provide a sample analysis for anyone interested in looking at CS. I look at mainly the pistol round here but many of the techniques can be applied to all types of rounds. There are many ways to analyze this dataset so I hope you can go off and answer interesting questions for yourself :)

The following questions will be answered in this notebook:

What are the most common pistol round buys? What is the ADR by each pistol on pistol rounds? What sites do bomb get planted the most on pistol rounds? After bomb gets planted at A/B Site, for all XvX situation, what is the win Probability for Ts? In a 1v1, 1v2, 2v1, 2v2, should players play out of site/in-site or one-in one-out to deal the most damage while receiving the least?
